 * The one surface the reader is showing over its page, if any.

 * toolbar, a mark popover, the image viewer and an external-link confirmation all want the same attention and
 * the same slice of the screen. Holding them as one value is what makes that
 * exclusivity true, rather than something each opener has to remember: the
 * previous shape kept five independent flags, and every one of the six ways to
 * open a surface cleared a different subset of the other four. Opening search
 * left an open footnote on screen, opening a footnote left the selection
 * toolbar up, and so on.
